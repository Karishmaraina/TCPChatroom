Implementing a fully-functioning TCP chat using Python programming language.Here we have one server that hosts the chat and multiple clients that connect to it and communicate with each other. For our application, we will use the client-server architecture. This means that we will have multiple clients (the users) and one central server that hosts everything and provides the data for these clients.
